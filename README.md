# Quantum-Black-Feature-Engineering-Hackathon-2019

Problem Statement

Develop inputs for a model that predicts the chances of having a vehicle accident based on driving conditions. This model will help the transport authority to understand risk patterns and act upon them.

Data Description

1. Drive Data (Connected car data) — Data coming from the car-mounted devices, which provides you with the car statistics every second. This information will include — Speed, acceleration, engine temperature and other car statistics.

2. Trip — Parameters associated with location of car such as lattitude, longitude, altitude and other similar parameters

3. Weather — Weather condition at different latitude & longitude during different times each day.

4. Vehicle Specifications — Different vehicle technical specifications which comes from the manufacturer of the car.
